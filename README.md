# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This machine learning project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for digit classification. Similar to the Decision Trees project, it aims to predict the correct digit based on various features.

Special thanks to Ali Ahmed, Ahmed Ayman, and Mostafa Ahmed for their valuable contributions and assistance in this project.

## 🚀 Dataset Information:
The dataset is loaded from the sklearn library and contains information about digits, including pixel values.

## ⚙️ Model Training:
A K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier is trained on the dataset using a 70-30 train-test split. The model's accuracy and confusion matrix are then evaluated.

## 💰 Results:
Accuracy: 0.9737678855325914

## ⚡ Technologies Used:
Python
